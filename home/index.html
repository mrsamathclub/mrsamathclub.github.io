  <h3 class = "desc">About Us</h3>
  <p class = "desc" style = "width: 350px;">The purpose of our club is to help 4th and 5th graders become prepared to take middle and high school math
  contests. I hope to engage them in mathematics that is usually not taught in the regular curriculum at school. This includes Number Theory,
  Combinatorics, Probability, Competition Geometry, and other topics necessary for high preformance in math competitions. The main competitions
  that we will be preparing for are the AMC 8, MathCounts, and the North Carolina State Exam. After participating in this club, students can be 
  expected to have a basic understanding of base numbers, modular arithmetic, the Angle Bisector Theorem, Stewarts Theorem, and other famous
  mathematical results that are applied in competitions. </p>
