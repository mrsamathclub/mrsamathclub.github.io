  <h3 class = "desc">About Us</h3>
  <p class = "desc" style = "width: 150px;">The purpose of our club is to help 4th and 5th graders become prepared to take middle and high school math
  contests. I hope to engage them in mathematics that is usually not taught in the regular curriculum at school. </p>
