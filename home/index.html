  <h3>About our Curriculum</h3>
  <p>The purpose of our club is to help 4th and 5th graders become prepared to take middle and high school math
  contests. I hope to engage them in mathematics that is usually not taught in the regular curriculum at school. This includes Number Theory,
  Combinatorics, Probability, Competition Geometry, and other topics necessary for high preformance in math competitions. The main competitions
  that we will be preparing for are the AMC 8, MathCounts, and the North Carolina State Exam. After participating in this club, students can be 
  expected to have a basic understanding of base numbers, modular arithmetic, the Angle Bisector Theorem, Stewarts Theorem, and other famous
  mathematical results that are applied in competitions. You can find more about the topics we will cover on the Overview Page.</p>

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>My name is Joseph Campbell, and I am currently an 8th grader at Metrolina. I am very enthusiastic about math and I
  would like to help the next generation of students at Metrolina succeed in math competitions. I have finished all of the mathematical
  curriculum at Metrolina, and I am currently taking Pre-Calculus in AoPS. I also compiled a math competition preparation guide that Mr.
  Chavel sent out at the end of the year. I hope you enjoy this club!
